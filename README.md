  ✍️ Hello, I am Hasan, I am a react front-end developer. While I was at the university, I realized that I had an interest and talent in the field of software while taking software courses, and I started by learning react front-end. I have been improving myself in react front-end and other software areas that I am interested in for more than a year.
  
 💪 I use HTML5, CSS3, SASS, SCSS, Boostrap, Tailwind, Javascript, React.js, Reac-Redux, React-Toolkit software languages ​​and libraries in my projects. Additionally, I create my projects by applying responsive design suitable for laptops and phones.
 
 🌙 I like to learn new things every day, apply and discover what I have learned about software, the world of the future.I like to work alone or in a team and exchange information.
