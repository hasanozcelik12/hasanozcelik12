  ✍️ I started my career working as an electrical manager in a biogas energy company. Here, I generally contributed to solving various electrical and mechanical faults in the field. Then, due to my interest and curiosity, I decided to improve myself in the software industry. So far, I have done many projects using React technology in three different companies.As a creative problem-solver, I enjoy tackling challenges, streamlining development processes, and improving project efficiency. My previous work and educational background have equipped me with strong analytical and problem-solving skills, which I continuously apply in my development projects.
  
 💪 I use HTML5, CSS3, SASS, SCSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Javascript, React.js, Reac-Redux, React-Toolkit,React Native CLI,Expo software languages ​​and libraries in my projects. Additionally, I create my projects by applying responsive design suitable for laptops and phones.
 
 🌙 I like to learn new things every day, apply and discover what I have learned about software, the world of the future.I like to work alone or in a team and exchange information.
